Gracie University iOS Application Documentation
===============================================

Getting Started
---------------
This iOS-based application was created to help track progress for students registered in Gracie University's Jiu Jitsu Program. It is important to note that this project is still in its alpha stage and provides a gorgeous iOS-based UI for visualizing progress. At its current state, it does not require a back-end database to run. In order to gain the most function, however, it can be integrated with a database of users and classes to overtake the use of paper cards in tracking stripe progress. 

Documentation Package
---------------------
**SRS Document**
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for software package located at : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9AUHx1jtWcwMUU5Wk9WTnk5VEk/view
and provides Gracie University iOS requirements. 


**Gracie University Prototype**
Gracie University iOS application prototype located at: 
https://invis.io/WXBCMWY35 and is the first prototype with requirements. Application designed with this first prototype in mind. 


Installation
------------

The above source code is fully contained and doesn't rely on any particular dependencies. In order to download and use for further development, there are a few items needed.
The first is the program, Xcode, Apple's iOS IDE. This program was built using the latest version of Xcode to date, [version 8.3.1](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=36). It is also built using the current Swift syntax, [version 3.1](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=36).
Xcode version 8 or later can be downloaded through the [App Store.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiP9Zueht_TAhVEslQKHVD7CkkQFggzMAI&url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&usg=AFQjCNGrxKmVtXUdvUU3MhqZhP4MHT6Gtg&sig2=ZO3nnvsdGrUpyTkduydrZA)
Once Xcode is in place, download the above source code. At the top right, there is a '[clone or download](https://github.com/adambeee/gracieuniversityiOS.git)' button that will either download the .zip file of the iOS application source code or if you are using git versioning control, will checkout the master branch. 

Reading Data
------------

This application was developed with the intention of reading from a connected database. During development, a database with these properties were utilized. 
![SQL Data Dump](https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/3BImR8zMv.png)
Any database will work but will need some external API to insert data into database and pull data for use with this iOS application. The external API can be written in any server-side scripting language but was outside the scope of this project. This software and database sitting in the middle of the Gracie University back-end and this client-side application will provide the necessary connections to provide a seamless experience to students. 

Application Overview
--------

**Dashboard**


----------


Once downloaded to your Mac System, a double-click on *GracieUniversityProgressTracker.xcodeproj* will open up the project in Xcode. 
The iOS application is a common four-tabbed application with each tab doing a particular task. 
The first tab is the dashboard, where a users progress is highlighted by two concentric rings. 
![enter image description here](https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/mlUjZzAd.png)

The outer progress bar is current progress towards a belt and the inner progress bar is the amount of stripes towards that belt. The more stripes completed, the inner progress bar overlaps and a numeric designates the current stripe (1-4).

Progress bar functionality provided by this github project:
(https://github.com/CardinalNow/iOS-CircleProgressView)

Added to swift by including `CircleProgressView.swift` to project. 
This layout will take student_card object, and use the fields: `stripe_level = 2` and `classes_completed=26` to provide the appropriate progress for that user. This view changes depending on current user - captured with sign-on.

Below the dashboard layout is the listing of classes for reference. This is provided by querying the `class table` and also the `rd_class table`. 

The amount of rows dictated by the count of classes in the above tables. 
Re-write the following segment of code in `RegularClassesTableViewController.swift`
to

     override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        // #warning Incomplete implementation, return the number of rows
        return regularClassArray.count
    }
return to return the number of classes in the table.
Complete the same in `ReflexDevelopmentTableViewController.swift` for reflex development courses. 

Updating each cell content with name of the classes should result in the following view for names of classes. 

![Regular Classes View](https://preview.ibb.co/gwbjd5/Simulator_Screen_Shot_May_7_2017_7_11_15_PM.png)

Updating cells for reflex development course names should make for a similar result. 


**Gracie University Site and Calendar**


----------

The next two tabs, Gracie University and Calendar are views for accessing web content within the application itself. 

Within the project are two files, 

    SecondViewController.swift
and 

    ThirdViewController.swift
that are both inheriting from the `UIViewController` superclass. 

Each page pulls its content via this block of code in `ViewDidLoad()` for that page.

    let url = URL(string: "https://www.gracieuniversity.com")
        let urlRequest = URLRequest(url: url!)
        GracieUniversityHomePage.loadRequest(urlRequest)
        
        activityIndicator.startAnimating()
        activityIndicator.hidesWhenStopped = true
        
        GracieUniversityHomePage.delegate = self

Update url to be any linkable content.

**Settings Tab** 


----------

The last page is a demo settings page for any necessary user profile information. This can allow users to enter in, or pull from Apple's Health API, their weight and height to calculate potential calories for each class. This added feature, that can be implemented in the class table, will provide an immersive experience for a student and keep them motivated.

Conclusions and Support
-----------------------

Developmental efforts with this application focused mostly on the UI aspect of tracking progress. If Gracie University wanted to implement this application as a part of their students immersive experience, it would need minimal effort to do so. The architecture on how to connect our application to a database is in place, it just needs an API in place to communicate from a back-end system to this iOS application. This application package is offered without any implied support but can be downloaded and changed without permission.
